    "intro": "When I was told that I had to make yet another written assignment during my Suzuki violin teaching course, I knew using a traditional word/pdf document with some images was not what I wanted. So I researched and decided to build an interactive web app to display the music scores and the pedagogical analysis on top of them.",
    "description": "This static site displays the scores from the Suzuki Violin Method books. A multi-layered, clickable SVG overlay holds the information on the piece structure and teaching points (also divided in right/left hands). The audio of the piece is also playable while looking at the score. Altough the site is built in  a very ineficient way, the result was very satisfactory and I look forward to rebuild the site using modern rendering template systems. Built using HTML, CSS and Javascript",
    "features": [
      {"name": "SVG", "text": "Vector graphics offer very interesting possibilities in web design. In this case, I took advantage of inline SVG shapes made in Adobe Illustrator, with click events added, to toogle visibility of each layer of content.", "image": "image placeholder"},

    ],
    "learning": "I learned simple HTML and CSS, with a bit of Javascript for the SVG interface. I also practised prototyping and SVG handling in Adobe Illustrator.",
    "problems": "The code is redundant, since each html file has a big css file that could be shared between all pages. The javascript code could be much simpler if it used functions and loops. And the architecure is funny, actually each page contains all the image files, html, css, js, and even font files instead of actually having them all in a shared folder.",

    "intro": "This was my first dynamic website, and it's building took months. I wanted to make a ranking site for an online game with replay storage. The app is hosted and built using Amazon Web Services, which was both a big challenge and lots of fun.",
    "description": "This app works in a simple way: Players register, upload games between each other, and recieve an ELO score based on their wins/loses. Their games and replays get stored, and the page displays a ranking, a replay list (with download links) and statistics from all the games played. Future plans include multilingual support, a replay parser (kindly written and gifted by FG15), and a season system. Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Chartist.js, Node.js and MYSQL.",

Lambda functions run on request every time the API calls them. In this way, we can handle the database CRUD operations easily on demand.

I chose Chartist.js for their lightweight, svg-based library. It is easily customizable using CSS and its API is simple to use.", "image": "image placeholder"}

    "learning": "This project was a big task. On the one hand, I learned more about HTML and CSS, designed and built SVG images for the UI, and used a bit of JQuery. On the other hand, I needed to learn backend tecnologies such as Node.js, several AWS services and their APIs, and MYSQL for database queries.",
    "problems": "The frontend code is composed of CSS spaghettis and Js + JQuery spaghettis. There is a lot of unnecessary repetition, and the javascript code is not properly structured into separate files. Also, the loading times are very big because images are not optimized. The tables that display rankings and replays load all their items (+300!) at once.",
