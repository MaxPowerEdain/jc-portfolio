    <p class="t-body-primary"><span class="t-header-small">Before,</span>
    I studied violin for 18 years in Valencia, Zaragoza and Vienna, following a carrear as teacher, freelance orchestral player and soloist. I developed discipline, endurance, self-learning skills, motivation, and improvement mindset.</p>
    <p class="t-body-primary"><span class="t-header-small">Now,</span>
    I have finished a Frontend Bootcamp in Factor√≠a F5, where I learned about Agile development, teamwork, and modern web-development tecnologies and tools. I continue gaining knowledge in their Fullstack Bootcamp. And I also strenghten my programming skills by coding C++ in UE4 as UI developer in the fan-project BFME Reforged.</p>
    <p class="t-body-primary"><span class="t-header-small">Next,</span>
    I am deepening my knowledge of Vue.js and backend languages and frameworks. In the future, I look forward to work with Cloud-based solutions to build the backend for flexible and scalable apps. Other areas of interest/specialization include low-level programming (C/C++) and web/cloud security management.</p>
